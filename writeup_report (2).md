### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

In this project, I used Python and OpenCV to find the lane lines and creating averaged and extrapolated boundary line.
**My pipeline consists of following steps,**


1.Convert original image to HSL.

2.Isolate yellow and white from HSL image

3.Combine isolated HSL with original image

4.Convert image to grayscale.

5.Apply Gaussian Blur to smoothen the gray image for better edges detection.

6.Apply Canny Edge Detection on smoothed gray image to detect edges

7.Trace Region of Interest and discard all other lines identified by canny edge detection that are outside this region

8. Perform a Hough Transform to find lanes within our region of interest and trace them in red

7.Draw extrapolated lines to extend over detected lane lines.

![alt text][image8]

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function to calculating the mean slope for  left and right line. Based on those we are deciding the whether it right or left lane. Then I calculate the average of slopes and intercept and based on those finding the X co-ordinates(The line which have minimum value of y and Iâ€™m Considering as the y_min )


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

    
It only detects the straight lane lines. I could see curve lines in video, the same project can be extending for detecting curve lines.




### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

1.One possible improvement could be to avoid shakiness of lines drawn in video .

2.Another possible improvement could be selecting the tuning parameters (vertices, threshold)
